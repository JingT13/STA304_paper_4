# Datasheet

**Motivation**

1. *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*
    - The dataset aims to collect, analyze and disseminate population data on fertility, family planning and maternal and child health in the Philippines. 
2. *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    - The dataset was created by National Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS), alongside the National Statistics Office in collaboration with the Department of Health (DOH), the University of the Philippines Population Institute, and other concerned agencies in the Philippine government. 
3. *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    - The creation was funded by the Government of Philippine.

**Composition**

1. *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
 - The instances represent the educational level of Philippine. The types are: sex, age groups and regions.

2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
 - There are 32 instances
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
 - The 1998 NDHS sample is a sub-sample of the new master sample of the Integrated Survey of Households (ISH) of the NSO. In this data, every region; age group and sexes was included. We could say the dataset does contain all possible instances.
4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
 - In the raw data, the instance consists of 32 variables. 
5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
 - None.
6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
 - There is no missing individual instances. 
7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
 - There are no relationships between individual instances.
8. *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
 - There are no recommended data splits.
9. *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
 - There are no errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset.
10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)?

Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
 - The dataset is self-contained.
11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*
 - There is no confidential data, and the dataset is publicly available.
12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
 - Columns that might cause anxiety include: the education level in different regions are different, this may lead to some inferiority complex. 
13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*

 - It is not possible to identify individuals in any way.
15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
 - Sensitive columns may include but are not limited to: different education levels for men and women.

**Collection process**

1. *How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If the data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.*
 - The 1998 National Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) was the seventh in a series of population surveys conducted every five years since 1968. Using the way of asking people to fill questionnaires.
