Abstract: When social problems are being paid more and more attention, education is an indispensable topic, because education affects the development of the whole society. Then this report is to study and analyze the situation of education level through the National Demographic and Health Survey 1998 in the Philippines. We would like to know what will influence a country’s education level? Based on the data from the National Demographic and Health Survey 1998 in the Philippines, we find out that the different age groups, different genders, and the differences of regions can influence the education level, through this report, we can have a more comprehensive understanding of the social issue of education level.
