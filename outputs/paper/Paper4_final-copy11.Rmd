abstract: "When social problems are being paid more and more attention, education is an indispensable topic, because education affects the development of the whole society. Then this report is to study and analyze the situation of education level through the National Demographic and Health Survey 1998 in the Philippines. We would like to know what will influence a countryâ€™s education level? Based on the data from the National Demographic and Health Survey 1998 in the Philippines, we find out that the different age groups, different genders, and the differences of regions can influence the education level, through this report, we can have a more comprehensive understanding of the social issue of education level."

# 1 Introduction

With the development of society, there is an increasing demand for education, because education can help people improve their speaking skills, develop critical thinking, promote gender equality, and improve their cognitive system after learning knowledge(@aa). The education level of the current society is not only for individuals, but also to show the development level of a society and a country. Therefore, we selected the education level of the Philippines among many countries for further analysis. To be specific, we selected some data about education levels from National Demographic and Health Survey 1998 in the Philippines for the following research and analysis.

In this paper, the main idea is about analyzing education levels in the Philippines through the data on age, gender, and region. The first is to observe whether people of each age group participate in their education level relative to what they need to achieve through age data. Because not every age group can receive the corresponding educational conditions in time. Then there is the data about gender, hoping to observe whether men and women receive equal education in this country through the data of gender. As we mentioned above, education is not only about academics, but also about promoting gender equality. Therefore, we hope to analyze whether the education rate is balanced for men and women through gender data. On the other hand, education levels in urban and rural areas. From this data, we can analyze whether there is a big gap between urban and rural education levels. 

In the National Demographic and Health Survey 1998, we selected data about education levels for analysis. The first step is to import the data from the Survey. Then it is data cleaning, specifically, the transformation of some wrong typed of data, filtering out missing values and some useless data. Then the data of age, gender, and residence are plotted and analyzed by graphs and tables.In the Results section, we find the relationship between age and respondents' education levl, schooling time; regions and respondents' education level; gender and respondents' education level. In the discussion section, we discuss whether our results match the real cases, and then think about limitations and future.

To gain a better understanding of the Philippines Demographic and Health Survey(DHS) on education, I utilized the data from Philippines DHS 1998, final report in PDF format. The data is collected and provided by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The data has been sourced in a reproducible way, with a script for downloading and obtaining the relevant datasets.In this dataset, the raw data includes 8 variables so we cleaned and extracted the important data to start our analysis. In the analysis, we will useR statistical language [@1], tidyverse packages [@3], pdftools [@4], stringi,tibble [@8], devtools, dplyr [@7], fmsb[@9], janitor[@2], formattable[@12], kableExtra[@11]. 
 
Firstly, we selected all variables that we will use in analysis from the raw data, they are related to people's education level, age group, gender and region in the Philippines. Because of the survey using a whole table to describe age groups, regions and gender, we will create four new datasets to start our analysis. The first two datasets are about the relationship between male or female respondents' age and their education levels. The next two datasets are about relationships between male or female respondents' regions and their education levels. Some of the variables that we will use in our analysis are background characteristics, elementary education, high school, college or higher, number of males, number of females and median number of years of schooling. Then we use pintblank to check the validation. Then, we will use the select function to delete missing values and total because they are meaningless in our analysis. 

## 2.2 Methodology

The National Demographic and Health Survey 1998 is about collecting, analyzing, and disseminating population data on fertility, family planning, and maternal and child health in the Philippines. The survey was picked sub-sample from the Integrated Survey of Households (ISH) of the NSO. Data collection is mainly carried out in the form of a questionnaire survey among people in each region. Data for each region, age, and gender are included, and the dataset contains all possible instances.

## 2.3 Variables

We will introduce each variable respectively with plots and tables that are created by kableExtra[(Zhu 2021) and ggplot2. Firstly, three variables of education levels which are elementary education, high school and college are most important in our analysis. In Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3, red bars represent female and blue bars represent male. From Figure 1, we can see the percentage of male and female respondents who just have elementary education at different age groups. From Figure 2, we can see the percentage of male and female respondents who attend high school at different age groups. However, the age group from 6 to 9 has no value because there are no 6-9 years old respondents in high school. From Figure 3, we can see the percentage of male and female respondents who attend college or higher education. Age group from 6 to 14 has no value. Moreover, Figure 4 and Figure 5 both introduce the median number of years of schooling for male and female. At last, the map describes another important variable, regions. The Philippines is consist of Metro Manila, Cordillera Admin, Ilocos, Cagayan Valley, C.Luzon, S.Tagalog, Bicol, W.Visayas, C.Visayas, E.Visayas, W.Mindanao, N.Mindanao, S.Mindanao, C.Mindanao.

# 3 Result Section
## 3.1 Age

From line graphs at the first row, a blue line which represents male and a red line which represents female respectively. They both describe the relationship between the number of respondents who are educated and their age. Generally, two lines show a decreasing slope from 15-24 to 65+. Most number of respondents who are education attended is at 15-24 age group(approximate 5500) and least number of respondents who are education attended is at 65+ age group(approximate 1000). With increasing age, the number of respondents who are educated decreases sharply. From line graphs at the second row, they describe the years of male and female respondents schooling. We can see the center at age from 25 to 44, which means respondents who are in the 25-44 age group experience the longest schooling time, longer than 9 years. 65+ years old respondents have the shortest schooling time, less than 4 years.

## 3.2 Region

From table 1, we can see most respondents have college or higher education in the region of Metro Manila and their schooling time is the longest(9.3 years). Thus, Metro Manila has a strong educational force. Only ten percent of respondents have college or higher education in the region of E.Visayas and most respondents just attend elementary education with the shortest schooling time(4.5 years). Respondents who live in regions of Mindanao and Visayas have weak educational forces. From radar charts, black lines mean rural education and red lines mean urban education. We can see the number of rural respondents who just have elementary is more than the number of urban respondents significantly because the black point is above the red point at the Elementary. Furthermore, the number of urban respondents who have college or higher education is more than the number of rural respondents.

## 3.3 Gender

From the above line graphs, we can make two comparisons between male and female. The first comparison is the number of respondents who are educated between male and female and the second comparison is the schooling time of respondents who are educated between male and female. We can see that the line graphs at the first row have a similar slope, it means that the number of male and females who are educated are almost equal at different age groups. Moreover, the line graphs at the second row have similar slopes as well, it means that male and female experience an equal schooling time. The radar charts from the last result show male and female respondents have a similar situation as well in rural or urban areas. 

Figure () shows male respondents' education levels which are elementary, high school and college or higher. We can see elementary takes the biggest share(48.8%), most male respondents only experience elementary education. College or higher takes the smallest share(18.2%). Figure () shows female respondents' education level. It has a similar situation with male's, elementary education is the biggest share (46.6%) and college or higher is the smallest share(19.8).

# 4 Discussion 
The above analysis indicates how age, gender, and region impact people's education level in The Philippines. Start by analyzing the educational attainment of different age groups in the Philippines and the number of years they have been in education. After that, the education level in the Philippines is compared and analyzed through the proportion of males and females in the education level in graphs of different genders. Then it explores the differences in education levels between urban and rural men and women at different levels. The following paragraphs will talk about more specific data feedback on these three aspects and whether further discussion on educational level can be carried out in the future.

## 4.1 Age 

The two figures in the first row show the analysis of the different numbers of people in different age groups in education. As we can see the age of 15-24 owns the highest number of educated people. And the 65+ group has the lowest number of educated people. And the two line groups in the second line show that people of different age groups have different years of education. It can be seen that people aged 25-34 have the highest number of years of education, and people aged 65+ have the least number of years of education.
In fact, people's social activities are determined by the response to the development stage of our brain. This includes the different education levels of people of different ages in this paper. For example, the most educated people are between the ages of 15 to 24, because our brains complete brain development at the age of 25, and until then our brains are not fully developed, which means that we are not fully in control of and able to determine our social behavior (@bb). which means people need to improve the way of thinking and make some contributions to the development of the brain through continuous learning at the age of 15 to 24. So in line graph above, the group of people aged 15 to 24 who are studying is the largest. Compared to the pre-colonial period, the education system in the Philippines changed significantly after 1990, from only vocational training for all children to the 1991 REPORT of the US Congressional Committee on Education (EDCOM), which recommended DECS be divided into three parts. That is, academic education to vocational education have a more perfect system. The second row of line graphs shows that the people aged 25-34 have the longest number of years of education, and the age group from 15 to 24 is still in school. The education system in the Philippines is constantly improving so that more people can receive a better education. In this paper, we could not make a more comprehensive analysis of the reasons for people to receive education at different ages and their choices through data. In the future analysis, we can further explore the factors of different age groups in the Philippines for their choice of study(@cc).

## 4.2 Region

The pie charts above showed the educational level of people in both urban and rural areas. To be specific, these bar charts all have a common feature that elementary accounts for more than 37% and the proportion is the largest, while college or higher accounts for the least. And then the proportion of elementary part in the rural is almost twice as high as that in the urban. The proportion of college or higher students in rural areas is nearly three times lower than that in urban areas.

There are many impacts that affect the education level in urban and rural areas.Since urban and rural are different from each other in terms of economic development, vocational demand, or education development system, they play an important role in urban and rural people's education levels.For example, some places in urban will attract more people with higher education through higher salaries and superior consumption facilities. In fact, another way of understanding is that such an incentive method in urban can make more people pursue more education (@dd). Therefore, according to the pie chart, we can see why the proportion of college or higher in cities is so much higher than that in urban and rural areas. Because the speed of urban development and social needs continue to spur people. This is just one example, and there are many, many more reasons. The data in the paper only tells us the proportion of different education levels in urban and rural, so that we can explore how urban and rural have an impact on education levels in a more detailed way in the future study. Further research can be carried out through the economic development, education system, and policy mentioned above to start the analysis.

## 4.3 Gender

In most developing countries, such as China and Thailand, men are more educated than women. In the Philippines, however, this data comparison of educational level is the exact opposite. In most cases, Filipino women are more educated than men. In the data section, we also just discussed the educational level of men and women in the Philippines, and it does confirm this[@b]. Based on this information, we know that maybe these are related to the cost and benefit of education [@a]. In terms of school construction, if it is in some village areas, it provides a "short distance". While female enrolment in schools increases by 3%, male enrolment increases by only 1%. Another reason is that schools have more female teachers than male teachers. In some traditional families, parents would expect their daughter's teacher to be a woman. So schools with a higher proportion of female teachers have many girls enrolled. This is one of the reasons why female enrolment rates are higher than males.
